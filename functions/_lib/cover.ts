 * both directions. Measured across 13 volumes: a real cover at zoom 2 came in
 * at 12,934 bytes and was rejected for being 66 bytes light, so the page fell
 * back to the zoom 1 image; another at 10,626 was rejected at zoom 2 and its
 * zoom 1 at 4,786 was rejected too, leaving that book with no cover at all.
 * Whether art exists is now cache-control's answer (see below).
 *
 * What weight still catches is Google occasionally returning a blank sliver —
 * one volume answers zoom 2 with a 300x48 white bar of 1,026 bytes, marked
 * durable. The smallest real cover measured was 4,786 bytes and the largest

 * which is exactly the question here, so that is what we read.
 *
 * Byte size cannot answer it. The placeholder rendered at zoom 2 is 15,567
 * bytes — larger than that zoom's threshold, so it was accepted, and the
 * cascade stopped before reaching a zoom that had the real jacket. Raising the
 * threshold past it is not available either: of ten real covers measured at
 * zoom 2, two are smaller than the placeholder (10,626 and 12,934 bytes).
 * Content type does not separate them either — the placeholder is a PNG, but
 * so is a real line-art cover measured at 86,631 bytes.
 *
 * Checked against 39 responses (13 volumes x 3 zooms): every placeholder said
 * 30, every real cover 86400, including the volume that has real art at zoom 1
 * and the placeholder above it. The cutoff sits between the two by an order of
 * magnitude on either side, so a change to Google's exact numbers has room
 * before it reverses the decision.
