 * compares a *decoded* route parameter against an *encoded* URL string. They
 * differ for any segment that needed escaping — `/a%20b/search` yields the
 * parameter `a b`, which does not occur in the URL — so the replace found
 * nothing, the guard returned the URL it was given, and navigating to it ran
 * the guard again: a redirect loop rather than a fallback.
 *
 * Editing the parsed tree sidesteps the comparison entirely, and carries query
 * parameters, matrix parameters and the fragment across untouched.

 * page the link was for and lands on the homepage instead, query string and
 * all. Recognising it as a route means prefixing rather than replacing.
 *
 * Read off the live route table at call time rather than importing it: the
 * route table imports this guard, and importing it back would be a cycle
