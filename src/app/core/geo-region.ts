/** IP-based region detection for a first visit.
 *
 * Two independent sources, both answered from the visitor's IP by Cloudflare:
 *
 * 1. The backend's /core/geo/, which reads the CDN's country header. It is
 *    the primary: the header name is a backend setting, so it survives a
 *    move of the API to another CDN.
 * 2. /cdn-cgi/trace on this site's own origin, served by Cloudflare Pages.
 *    The backup for when the API's proxy is switched off or the API is down.
 *    It is a documented Cloudflare troubleshooting endpoint, but plain text
 *    with no versioned format, so it is parsed defensively and never trusted
 *    alone over the backend.
 *
 * Both start together so a failing backend costs no extra round trip, and the
 * whole lookup is capped: a first visit waits at most `timeoutMs` before the
 * caller falls back to the timezone guess.
